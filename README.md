# Bubble-wrap-ANOVA

Company XX is a manufacturer of several types of protective packaging, including bubble wrap sold in both retail and bulk. The objective of this project is to determine the best operating conditions for the bubble wrap lines to increase production capacity.

Variables such as extrusion rate, temperature, line speed, and percent loading of additives were key factors that were considered in the study. After preliminary experiments, the engineers decided that line speed, and percent loading of additives were the most significant factors and thus a complete randomized (also called factorial) design was implemented with these two factors:

Factors	Levels
Line Speed (m/mm)	36	37	38
Loading of Additives	0	2	4

The response variable was the production rate measured in lbs/hr. The experiment was replicated 3 times and the randomization order for each replication was also recorded. Our goal is to find the optimal combination of line speed and percent load of additives that results in the highest production rate in two cases:
(i)	When all observations are considered valid (Balanced Anova)
(ii)When some observations are removed (Unbalanced Anova)
